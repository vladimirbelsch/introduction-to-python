Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays


# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123, 0])


2D Arithmetic

# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# updated is available as 2D numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])
